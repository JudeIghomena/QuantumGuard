# QuantumGuard
QuantumGuard revolutionizes network security and monitoring for telecommunications by integrating quantum computing, AI, and blockchain technologies. The system leverages quantum algorithms to analyze vast amounts of network data at unprecedented speeds, detecting anomalies and potential threats.

Backend Integration: Ensure that the frontend makes API requests to the correct backend endpoints (axios.defaults.baseURL) defined in App.js.
WebSocket: Use WebSocket for real-time updates in the Dashboard screen (DashboardScreen.js).
Navigation: Implement screen navigation using React Navigation (App.js).
Styling: Customize styles in each screen using StyleSheet in React Native.
This structure and code outline provide a foundation for integrating both frontend and backend components into the QuantumGuard application. Adjustments may be needed based on specific requirements, additional features, and architectural preferences.
